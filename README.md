## Description
### This is a web application designed to help users to trade goods with each other without currency.

### For this app we choose to follow a decouple architecture. A decoupled architecture is a framework for complex work that allows components to remain completely autonomous and unaware of each other. This allows for a clear process in where both front and backend can work succinctly to make a fully functional app.
